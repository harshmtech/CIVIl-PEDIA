    <h1>Smart Materials in Civil Engineering</h1>
    <p>Smart materials, also known as intelligent or responsive materials, can sense environmental changes and respond accordingly. In civil engineering, they offer revolutionary capabilities like self-repair, structural monitoring, and climate adaptability — all contributing to more sustainable and long-lasting infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>📘 Definition</h2>
    <p>Smart materials have built-in sensing and actuating capabilities. They respond to stress, temperature, moisture, or electromagnetic fields, altering their properties such as shape, stiffness, or transparency.</p>

    <h2>🔍 Key Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Self-sensing:</strong> Detect stress, cracks, or temperature changes</li>
      <li><strong>Actuation:</strong> React to stimuli by expanding, changing form, or color</li>
      <li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> Return to original state after stimulus is removed</li>
      <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Function in harsh environmental conditions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔬 Types of Smart Materials</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs):</strong> Restore shape when heated; ideal for earthquake-resistant designs</li>
      <li><strong>Piezoelectric Materials:</strong> Generate electric charge under stress; used for monitoring and vibration control</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Healing Concrete:</strong> Uses bacteria or capsules to fill cracks automatically</li>
      <li><strong>Electrochromic Glass:</strong> Changes transparency with voltage; regulates indoor light and heat</li>
      <li><strong>Fibre Optic Sensors:</strong> Embedded for real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, and dams</li>
      <li><strong>Thermochromic & Photochromic Materials:</strong> Change color with heat or light exposure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🏗️ Applications in Civil Engineering</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bridge and building health monitoring</li>
      <li>Earthquake resistance with shape memory materials</li>
      <li>Self-healing roads and pavements</li>
      <li>Smart windows and facades for energy efficiency</li>
      <li>Vibration control in tall buildings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>✅ Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved structural safety and real-time feedback</li>
      <li>Lower maintenance costs</li>
      <li>Enhanced infrastructure resilience and lifespan</li>
      <li>Energy savings in building operations</li>
      <li>Advancement of sustainable construction methods</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📌 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Smart materials are transforming the future of civil engineering. By offering real-time responsiveness, self-repair, and enhanced performance, these materials help create safer, smarter, and more sustainable cities and infrastructure. Their use is expanding, and they are set to become integral to future engineering innovations.</p>
