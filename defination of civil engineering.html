  <h1>üß†Definition of Civil Engineering</h1>
    <p>
      Civil Engineering is one of the oldest and most essential branches of engineering that focuses on the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and built environment. This includes infrastructure projects like buildings, roads, bridges, dams, canals, tunnels, airports, water supply systems, and sewage treatment plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Civil engineering plays a crucial role in the development of any nation by providing the infrastructure required for transportation, housing, sanitation, energy, and environmental management.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term ‚Äúcivil engineering‚Äù was coined in the 18th century to distinguish it from military engineering. Today, it encompasses a broad range of disciplines and subfields, each specializing in different aspects of infrastructure and construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the primary responsibilities of civil engineers is to ensure that structures are safe, stable, sustainable, and cost-effective. They must consider various factors such as load, weather conditions, environmental impact, and materials while designing any structure. Their work starts from planning and continues through design, execution, and maintenance of structures.
