  <section class="intro">
    <p>Material selection is a crucial process in engineering that involves choosing the right materials for a specific application or structure. It ensures that infrastructures like buildings, bridges, and roads are safe, long-lasting, and cost-effective.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="factors">
    <h2>Key Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mechanical Properties:</strong> Strength, toughness, ductility. Example: Steel for high tensile strength.</li>
      <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Resistance to environmental conditions. Example: Treated wood in coastal areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost and Availability:</strong> Balancing performance with affordability.</li>
      <li><strong>Workability:</strong> Ease of shaping and assembling. Example: Aluminum and wood.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Eco-friendly options like bamboo and recycled steel.</li>
      <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> Visual appeal in architectural design.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety & Fire Resistance:</strong> Use of fire-rated and non-toxic materials.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="materials">
    <h2>Common Materials</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Concrete</strong> – Strong, durable, affordable.</li>
      <li><strong>Steel</strong> – High tensile strength, recyclable.</li>
      <li><strong>Bricks and Blocks</strong> – Traditional with good thermal insulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Timber</strong> – Lightweight and aesthetic.</li>
      <li><strong>Glass</strong> – Modern look and transparency.</li>
      <li><strong>Asphalt</strong> – Ideal for road surfacing.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right materials enhances safety, sustainability, and performance. With growing emphasis on eco-friendly construction, future materials will focus more on innovation and sustainability.</p>
