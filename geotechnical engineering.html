    <h1>Geotechnical Engineering</h1>

    <p>
      Geotechnical Engineering is a crucial branch of civil engineering that deals with the behavior of earth materials like soil, rock, and groundwater, and their interaction with man-made structures. It ensures that structures built on or within the ground are stable, safe, and durable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Geotechnical engineers investigate the soil and rock layers through site investigations like soil sampling, borehole drilling, lab testing, and in-situ tests (SPT, CPT). These help evaluate bearing capacity, settlement, shear strength, permeability, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Based on the findings, engineers design foundations of two main types:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shallow Foundations:</strong> Spread footings and mat foundations for strong surface soil.</li>
      <li><strong>Deep Foundations:</strong> Piles and caissons used when deeper support is needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      They also design <strong>retaining walls</strong>, check <strong>slope stability</strong>, and ensure the integrity of <strong>earth dams</strong> and <strong>groundwater control</strong> systems. Improper design can lead to landslides, collapses, or leakage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern geotechnical engineers use software like PLAXIS and GeoStudio, and tools like GPR and numerical modeling to simulate complex underground behavior and improve design accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      In disaster-prone areas, geotechnical engineering is vital. It helps design structures that can withstand earthquakes, floods, and other hazards.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In conclusion</strong>, geotechnical engineering forms the literal foundation of civil engineering projects. It ensures that what we build above is well supported below. Its importance grows as we develop in challenging environments.
