    <h1>Environmental Engineering</h1>

    <p>
      Environmental Engineering is a specialized field of civil engineering focused on protecting the environment and improving public health through sustainable solutions. It deals with managing air, water, and land resources while minimizing pollution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to balance human development and the natural environment. As cities and industries grow, environmental engineers use innovation and science to meet the rising need for clean air, water, and healthy living.
    </p>

    <p>
      A major role of environmental engineers is to design water and wastewater treatment systems using technologies like filtration, sedimentation, biological treatment, and disinfection to provide clean water and protect ecosystems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <strong>air pollution control</strong>, engineers create systems like filters, scrubbers, and catalytic converters, helping reduce emissions from vehicles and industries, improving air quality and public health.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Solid waste management</strong> is another vital area. Engineers design systems for waste collection, recycling, composting, and safe disposalâ€”including landfills and waste-to-energy plants to reduce environmental impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      They also handle <strong>hazardous waste management</strong> to prevent contamination. This includes treating toxic materials and cleaning up polluted sites through containment and remediation systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Environmental engineers work on <strong>climate change mitigation</strong> through renewable energy (solar, wind, bioenergy), green buildings, and infrastructure to withstand floods, droughts, and other extreme events.
    </p>

    <p>
      They also perform <strong>Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)</strong> to evaluate how projects affect ecosystems and suggest modifications to reduce harm.
    </p>

    <p>
      This field blends civil engineering, chemistry, biology, geology, and environmental science. Engineers use modeling tools and sensors to make informed, data-driven decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In conclusion</strong>, environmental engineering helps build a cleaner, safer, and sustainable future by protecting nature while supporting human development.
