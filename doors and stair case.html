    <h1>Doors and Staircases in Civil Engineering</h1>
    <p>Doors and staircases are fundamental to a building's functionality, safety, and design. Doors allow access, privacy, and security, while staircases enable vertical movement between floors, making them essential in multi-storey structures.</p>

    <h2>Doors</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>A door is a movable structure fixed within a wall opening that allows passage and provides privacy, insulation, and security.</p>

    <h3>Functions of Doors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enable access and separation of spaces</li>
      <li>Provide privacy and security</li>
      <li>Allow controlled ventilation and light</li>
      <li>Improve interior and exterior aesthetics</li>
      <li>Offer insulation and noise reduction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Doors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Panel Door:</strong> Decorative, made with wooden panels</li>
      <li><strong>Flush Door:</strong> Flat, plain, and economical</li>
      <li><strong>Glass Door:</strong> Modern, used in commercial spaces</li>
      <li><strong>Sliding Door:</strong> Space-saving, slides on tracks</li>
      <li><strong>Revolving Door:</strong> Common in commercial buildings</li>
      <li><strong>Swing Door:</strong> Opens both directions, seen in hotels and hospitals</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Door Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wood</li>
      <li>Steel/Aluminum</li>
      <li>Glass</li>
      <li>PVC/uPVC</li>
      <li>Fiberglass or composites</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Staircases</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>A staircase is a set of steps that enables people to move between different levels of a building. It is vital for vertical circulation and safety.</p>

    <h3>Functions of Staircases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enable safe movement between floors</li>
      <li>Serve as emergency exits</li>
      <li>Add aesthetic and architectural value</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Components of a Staircase</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tread:</strong> Horizontal surface stepped on</li>
      <li><strong>Riser:</strong> Vertical face between treads</li>
      <li><strong>Flight:</strong> Series of steps without interruption</li>
      <li><strong>Landing:</strong> Platform between flights</li>
      <li><strong>Handrail/Baluster:</strong> Provides support and safety</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Staircases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Straight:</strong> Single direction stairs</li>
      <li><strong>Dog-legged:</strong> Two flights in opposite directions with landing</li>
      <li><strong>Spiral:</strong> Circular stairs around a central pole</li>
      <li><strong>Helical:</strong> Curved, elegant stairways</li>
      <li><strong>Open-Well:</strong> Large space between flights</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC)</li>
      <li>Wood</li>
      <li>Steel</li>
      <li>Glass or Stone</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Doors and staircases are not just functional but vital for safety, comfort, and accessibility. Their design must consider aesthetics, strength, and compliance with building codes to enhance the usability and appeal of any structure.</p>
