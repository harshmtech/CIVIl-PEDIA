    <h1>Transportation Engineering</h1>

    <p>
      Transportation Engineering is a vital branch of civil engineering that focuses on the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of safe and efficient transportation systems. These include roads, railways, airways, waterways, ports, and public transit systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Transportation is crucial for economic growth, social development, and urbanization. Engineers develop infrastructure to meet current demands and adapt to future needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Highway Engineering</strong> is a key area that includes the design of roads, intersections, flyovers, and interchanges. Factors like traffic volume, speed, terrain, and safety are critical. Engineers apply geometric design and pavement engineering to create long-lasting, efficient roads.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Traffic Engineering</strong> focuses on managing the flow of vehicles and pedestrians. Using data from congestion and accidents, engineers improve movement with traffic signals, signage, road markings, roundabouts, and smart traffic systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Railway Engineering</strong> involves designing railway lines, stations, and signaling systems. Railways help reduce congestion and pollution, especially in urban areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Airport Engineering</strong> covers planning runways, taxiways, terminals, and control systems, while <strong>Port Engineering</strong> deals with docks, breakwaters, piers, and terminals for ships and cargo.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engineers also develop <strong>public transport systems</strong> like metro, BRT, and cycling lanes—key to affordable, low-emission travel. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) use sensors and data to manage traffic smartly in real-time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sustainability is central to modern transportation engineering. Engineers promote electric vehicles, walkable cities, and climate-resilient infrastructure to lower environmental impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In summary</strong>, transportation engineering is essential to connecting people and places, enabling progress, and ensuring safe, sustainable movement for society’s growth.
