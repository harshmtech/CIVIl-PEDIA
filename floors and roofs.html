    <h1>Floors and Roofs in Civil Engineering</h1>
    <p>Floors and roofs are two fundamental structural components of any building. Floors provide horizontal platforms for occupancy and use, while roofs serve as protective coverings against environmental elements like rain, sun, and wind.</p>

    <h2>Floors</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Floors are flat surfaces at various levels in a building that support loads from occupants, furniture, and equipment. They must resist both dead and live loads effectively.</p>

    <h3>Functions of Floors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide usable space for movement and furniture</li>
      <li>Transfer loads to beams and columns</li>
      <li>Offer fire, sound, and thermal resistance</li>
      <li>Enhance interior aesthetics</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Floors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ground Floor:</strong> Directly rests on the ground, usually concrete slab</li>
      <li><strong>Upper Floors:</strong> Supported by beams and columns (RCC, steel, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediate Floors (Mezzanine):</strong> Partial floors between two main levels</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types Based on Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Concrete Floors</li>
      <li>Wooden Floors</li>
      <li>Steel Decking Floors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Floor Finishes</h3>
    <p>Finishes include tiles, marble, vinyl, wood, terrazzo, or epoxy—chosen based on functionality and aesthetics.</p>

    <h2>Roofs</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>A roof is the uppermost cover of a building, designed to protect from sun, rain, wind, snow, and other external elements.</p>

    <h3>Functions of a Roof</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Protects building interiors from weather</li>
      <li>Provides insulation</li>
      <li>Enhances structure's lifespan</li>
      <li>Can house solar panels, HVAC units, rainwater systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Roofs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flat Roof:</strong> Common, easy to use and maintain</li>
      <li><strong>Pitched Roof:</strong> Sloped, suitable for high-rain/snow regions</li>
      <li><strong>Curved/Domed Roof:</strong> Aesthetic, used in temples and halls</li>
      <li><strong>Trussed Roof:</strong> Spans wide areas, used in auditoriums and warehouses</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Roofing Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>RCC (Reinforced Cement Concrete)</li>
      <li>Clay or concrete tiles</li>
      <li>Metal sheets (steel, aluminum)</li>
      <li>Asphalt shingles</li>
      <li>Polycarbonate sheets (skylights)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Floors and roofs are essential to a building’s structural and functional integrity. Floors support daily activities, while roofs provide environmental protection. Their design must balance strength, insulation, waterproofing, and aesthetics for a safe and comfortable structure.</p>
